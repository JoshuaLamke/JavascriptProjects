A collection of Javascipt applications I have been working on.
## Height Converter App
This app will take in a height in feet and inches and convert it to centimeters. The inputs will not accept anything other than a number.
## Hangman App
This app is a hangman game. It fetches a random two letter word from an API that returns random phrases and then you make guesses by pressing a letter key on your keyboard. If the letter is contained in the word, it will show up in the place of the **"*"** symbol. You have 5 guesses to figure out the word and if you fail to do so within the allotted guesses, you will be shown what word it was. A correct guess will not decrement your remaining guesses, only a wrong guess will.
## Notes App
This app allows you to take notes that will be saved to your local storage upon submission. You can search your notes by their title and filter them by last edited, last created, or alphabetically. 
## To-do App
This app allows you to write down the things that you have to do and they will be saved in local starage. You can check off the items as you do them or remove them if you wish. They can also be searched for by their title. You will be told how many todos you have left and you can filter the todos so that only uncompleted todos will show up.
